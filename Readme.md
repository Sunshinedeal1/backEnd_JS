 Node.js
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code on the server side, enabling the development of scalable network applications. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model, which makes it lightweight and efficient, particularly for handling multiple connections simultaneously.

Express.js
Express.js is a minimal and flexible web application framework for Node.js. It provides a robust set of features for building web and mobile applications, including routing, middleware support, and various HTTP utilities. Express.js simplifies the process of handling requests, responses, and middleware integration, making it a popular choice for building APIs and server-side applications.

Mongoose.js
Mongoose.js is an Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB and Node.js. It provides a schema-based solution to model application data and allows developers to interact with MongoDB using a more structured and user-friendly API. Mongoose simplifies data validation, type casting, and query building, making it easier to manage and manipulate data in a MongoDB database.
